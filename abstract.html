The internet is an becoming more and more important to our world and our way of life. 
 Since the dawn of the internet there where people around who would 
like to use it for their gain. Today we do banking business online and the safety aspect still is as relevant and important as it was years ago.
It makes sense that there is a great interest in making the web a secure space, because its so integral in our industrial way of life.
But then is the source of a problem online or on the PC in 99 percent of cases the user at the keyboard. So there is 
also and social aspect: people can only become victim if they are uninformed in the topic. With our OER we want to show people the potential and usages of zhis
technology but also inform the about the potential dangers. We want to show them certain behaviors and practices which minimize the risk of 
identity theft or tracking of personal information and data. For this we looked into a lot of online resources and did a brainstorm on what we
wanted to do. So we decided that we wanted a little practical part where the visitors of our OER could try some technical tricks by programming.
Kay looked into some of the latest hacks deployed by big players in the online scene and fetched a list of effective tools while Moritz would create the introduction
and the practical parts. For the later part it was very important to make some programming practice where your actions yield instant results like a headline on a 
website or a font color. At last we want to inspire visitor on our Website to inform themselves on the links we provide and give a brief peek 
into our course and aspired profession.
