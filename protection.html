        <h2>Safety Tipps</h2>
        Here we have some general good pratices for you to ensure maximum security
        <h3>choose a secure password</h3>
        A password is like a key to your house: If its bad, it is easier to break and go into your home and steal your stuff. In that case your private information like your online banking login data. Here you can check if your password is secure and read about some requirements for a good password. In general, passwords shouldn't contain dictionary words or concatenations of these words (for example, "House" is a bad password as well as "BigHouse")
        <h3>use a password manager</h3>
        You should have different passwords for different websites and change the frequently. To aid with this we recommend using a password manager program. Its like a safe which contains all of your password, locked away by a strong and easy to remember master password.

        <h3>use transparent, open source services</h3>
        For companies like Google, information about your online behavior is a true gold mine. Even if you leave no trace of your private information, Google can still track you and sell your data to Advertisement companies. For this purpose Neural Networks in huge server plants are fed with this information. They use artificial intelligence to find relations between anonymous data collected from huge data sets. The AI network can then make statements and predictions about a persons online behavior no human being would be able to. We recommend a search engine like
         <a href="https://www.startpage.com">startpage</a> or <a href="www.duckduckgo.com">duckduckgo</a>.
        <h3>
            use HTTPS
        </h3>

        HTTPS is a communications protocol similar to HTTP. It adds safety to the transmission process by encrypting the data it wants tom send and authentication of the transmission members (the client and server). This is especially important if you are using an public (open) WLAN where every member can possibly read the message. To check if a website uses HTTPS just look at the URL. If it starts with 'HTTPS' rather than 'http' you are using a secure site. You can use the browser extension 'HttpsEverywhere' to check if a site has secure versions.
