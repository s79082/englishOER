            Canvas
        </h2>
        <div class="text">
            Canvas is an HTML5 API for rendering Images in your Browser. This means that Images not must be loaded from a Server to show this on a Website. 
            The Server only give some Java-Script Code wich your Browser renders to an Image.
            <br>
            The Tracking- and Ad-Networks develop some tecnologies to use this Canvas API to Fingerprint you and you didnt see that. (Whats fingerprinting?)
            <br><br>
             1. With Java-Script you can write Text in Canvas API. After that your Browser render this Text. The Java-Script Code read this rendered Code as an Image and generates a hash value. This Hash Value is unique due to your Browser, CPU, OS, Rendering Software and so on. This method was described  2012 in the paper <a href="https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/W2SP/2012/papers/w2sp12-final4.pdf">Perfect Pixel</a><br>
            <br>
            2. a other Method to use the Canvas API to fingerprint you is the Canvas-Font-Printing wich describes the  <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arvindn/publications/OpenWPM_1_million_site_tracking_measurement.pdf">OpenWPM Paper</a>
            . For this they use the "CanvasRenderingContext2D" Objekt with their function "measureText". in the process you do not write a Text in the Canvas API but you identify the size of the Text of different fonts they need when they wirte on the website. 
            The ClientRects Test from <a href="https://www.browserleaks.com/rects">Browserleak</a> demonstrate this.
            <br><br>
            To See this methods into the wild We have make a short sreen captured Video wthen you visit the Website from the German Shipment Service DHL. 
            At firs you see the Website when you block all Java-Script Code on their Website. Then we enabled their Java-Script Code with the Plug-in "No-Script". 
            After that the Plugin "CanvasBlocker" pops up an alert for allowing Java-Script on the Website. 
            Wehen you allowed that you See that "CanvasBlocker" detect the hidden Canvas on the Website. DHL uses this not only on their landing Page.
            They use this as well on their Shipment Tracing Site. So be aware!
