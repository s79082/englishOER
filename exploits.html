        <h2>possible risks and exploits</h2>
        Below we have made a list to show you the most common exploits and safety issues and what you can do to protect you and yur data.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>XSS Attack</h3>Cross-Site Scripting, or XSS, is one of the most common browser-side vulnerabilities. These types of attacks happen an attacker injects malicious code into a legitimate (but vulnerable) application. Attackers can manipulate JavaScript and HTML to trigger the malicious code or scripts. In this way, the vulnerable 
                application or website is used as the “vehicle” to execute the script on the end user. <br>
                To combat this kind of attacks we recommend using a javascript blocker. This programm will block loading scripts from other websites or stopps the execution of code completely.
                You will find the javascript blocker of our choice on our Tools page <a href="tool.html">here</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>CSRF Attacks</h3><br>
                Cross-Site Request Forgery involves taking over or impersonating a user’s browser session by hijacking the session cookie. 
                CSRF attacks can trick users into executing malicious actions the attacker wants, or into taking unauthorized actions on the website. In this example, 
                the session cookie is the “vehicle” an attacker uses to impersonate a legitimate user.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Code injections</h3>
                This is the oldest but maybe easiest way to hack a server. With this attack you can inject malicious code by using 
                some input elements like an input field for passwords. If the servers is not secured against this kind of
                attacks, the server will execute the transmited code.
